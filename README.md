How do I approach designing software?

For me designing software is a trial and error process. When it comes to graphical processing, I compile and output the result quite often to make sure it is on track. On this assignment I probably pushed my gpu to its limit by the consistant rendering. I found I had to frequently shift objects and tweak lighting to get the desired effect. When it comes to coding I make sure to comment often and debug in blocks so that I do not progress too far and have to try to work backwards to fix an issue.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project has increased my skills significantly when it comes to shape building and lighting procedures. I have never used openGL before this so it was all new to me. Once I was able to craft shape classes I was able to build them into my program much easier. Something I could benefit more from that I learned some in this project is positioning on the X, Y, and Z axis. I feel this was the majority of my time spent on this project because objects just werent sitting right in perspective to the plane.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

The design process I implemented was printing the reference picture I took and keeping it next to me. This helped guide the direction I took on shape building and placement in the scene. Another part of the design process that I followed was writing down the given requirements for the final assignment and working through them block by block in the code. Then subsequent testing to make sure the desired result was accomplished.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I feel like anything graphically could follow this same process of using a reference picture. Also a key element of the testing process is dynamically testing as you write the code. This just means to build and run - rinse and repeat - once you have the code for that block requirement completed. Commenting is always imperative, because it tells what the code is intended to do. Also if you are not the only one working on a project coding "FIXME" could get resolution to roadblocks you may have faced.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach developing programs the same way I do any coding material or this project. Digestable requirements that can be built on, but it is also important for avoiding bias to periodically take a break from your work to sit back and see where improvements/changes could be made. Without this retrospective process I have found I become a bit "noseblind" to aspects of my program that just do not meet perfectly with requirements but suffice to accomplish a similar goal. This corner cutting is something I have found I subconsciously do. I implemented this retrospective time, but thankfully for me I also have a friend significantly better at coding than me that also takes a look over my work with honest open feedback.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I have never previously worked on 3D objects so I took the time to study videos and all the course material and try out different elements that were introduced and tweaked some code to challenge myself as well. This is not a developmental strategy I have had to implement before, because I typically know what I am doing when coding and this subject matter was lost on me a fair amount of the course.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration factors into all of my development because I constantly build and run with everything I design. This ensures I not only meet requirements but that I am free of buggy and error-ridden code. Digestable iterations is the most important - after being introduced to the waterfall method - I do not know how developers do it. For me I have to be always compiling and testing. Perhaps once I am more skilled in all of the languages this progression will occur but for me it has always worked best to code a block, comment as I write, and iterate the block.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

It has been 100% evolution, because as mentioned before I had zero experience with 3D building and openGL. As I encountered new material in the chapters I implemented it immediately. I particularly liked challenging myself with the ideas at the bottom of the referenced pages for each chapter. I have found that through the milestones and assistance of a friend who could explain it a lot differently I began to pick up the base concepts and evolve from those. One thing in particular that the milestones assisted with was getting me the starting block behind shape building, then texturing, camera, and lighting. Having this natural progression lended its hands into the final submitted project.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science is my goal - I am hoping that with a degree and the backbone of programming experience I have ammased through the coursework that I will be able to sufficiently get into a software engineering field where I can help others on projects and build ones of my own.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational and professional pathway?

As mentioned this is my goal. Being able to now understand more in regards to coordinate systems and how matrix multiplication helps has assisted greatly. Previous to the computer graphics and visualizations I picked up from this course I was only familiarized with graphical aspects of HTML in web building and text based output in Python and Java. This course and computational graphics and visualization will help me educationally tackle remaining courses with a wider expectation and also help aide in other programming avenues professionally.
